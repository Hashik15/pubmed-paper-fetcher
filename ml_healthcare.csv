40632147,MRI-based interpretable clinicoradiological and radiomics machine learning model for preoperative prediction of pituitary macroadenomas consistency: a dual-center study.,Meiheng Liang; Fei Wang; Yan Yang; Li Wen; Shunan Wang; Dong Zhang,Neuroradiology,2025-Jul-09,,,"PURPOSE: To establish an interpretable and non-invasive machine learning (ML) model using clinicoradiological predictors and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics features to predict the consistency of pituitary macroadenomas (PMAs) preoperatively. METHODS: Total 350 patients with PMA (272 from Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University and 78 from Daping Hospital of Army Medical University) were stratified and randomly divided into training and test cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. The tumor consistency was classified as soft or firm. Clinicoradiological predictors were examined utilizing univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Radiomics features were selected employing the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) classifiers were applied to construct the models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curve analyses (DCA) were performed to compare and validate the predictive capacities of the models. A comparative study of the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), and specificity (SPE) was performed. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) was applied to investigate the optimal model's interpretability. RESULTS: The combined model predicted the PMAs' consistency more effectively than the clinicoradiological and radiomics models. Specifically, the LR-combined model displayed optimal prediction performance (test cohort: AUC = 0.913; ACC = 0.840). The SHAP-based explanation of the LR-combined model suggests that the wavelet-transformed and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter features extracted from T CONCLUSION: An interpretable machine learning model incorporating clinicoradiological predictors and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)-based radiomics features may predict PMAs consistency, enabling tailored and precise therapies for patients with PMA.",Clinicoradiological; Consistency; Machine learning; Pituitary macroadenomas; Radiomics; Shapley additive explanation,10.1007/s00234-025-03698-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40632147
40631724,Disaggregating health differences and disparities with machine learning and observed-to-expected ratios: Application to major lower limb amputation.,Paula D Strassle; Samantha D Minc; Corey A Kalbaugh; Macarius M Donneyong; Jamie S Ko; Katharine L McGinigle,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",2025-Jul-09,,,"BACKGROUND: Major lower limb amputation is a devastating but preventable complication of peripheral artery disease. It is unclear whether racial and ethnic and rural differences in amputation rates are due to clinical, hospital, or structural factors. METHODS: We included all peripheral artery disease hospitalizations of patients ≥40 years old between 2017-2019 in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, or New York (HCUP State Inpatient Databases). We estimated the expected number of amputations using three models: 1) unadjusted, 2) adjusted for clinical factors, and 3) adjusted for clinical factors, hospital factors, and social determinants of health) using LASSO. We calculated and compared observed-to-expected ratios and quantified the role of these factors in amputation rates. RESULTS: Overall, 1,577,061 hospitalizations (990,152 unique patients) and 21,233 major lower limb amputations (1.4%) were included. After accounting for clinical differences, we observed amputation disparities among rural Black, Hispanic, Native American, and White patients and non-rural Black and Native American patients. After accounting for hospital factors and social determinants of health, disparities were no longer present among rural White adults (0.93, 95% CI 0.77-1.09); however, disparities persisted among rural Black (1.26, 95% CI 1.01-1.51), Hispanic (1.50, 95% CI 0.89-2.12), and Native American patients (1.13, 95% CI 0.68-1.58) and non-rural Black (1.12, 95% CI 1.09-1.15) and Native American (1.15, 95% CI 0.86-1.44) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical factors did not fully explain differences in amputation rates, and hospital factors and social determinants did not fully explain disparities. These findings provide additional evidence that implicit bias is associated with amputation disparities.",healthcare disparities; machine learning; major lower limb amputation; peripheral artery disease; rural health; social determinants of health; surgical,10.1097/EDE.0000000000001892,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40631724

This technological advancement allows for the automation of routine tasks, improved diagnostic accuracy, and the reduction of human error, leading to more efficient workflows. Moreover, the successful implementation of AI in healthcare requires comprehensive education and training for young clinicians, with a pressing need to incorporate AI into residency programmes, ensuring that future specialists are equipped with traditional skills and a deep understanding of AI technologies and their clinical applications. This includes knowledge of software, data analysis, imaging informatics and ethical considerations surrounding AI use in medicine. By fostering interdisciplinary integration and emphasising AI education, healthcare professionals can fully harness AI's potential to improve patient outcomes and advance the field of medical imaging and therapy.

40630578,Development of an AI-enabled predictive model to identify the 'sick child' at a pediatric telemedicine and medication delivery service in Haiti.,Ben J Brintz; Molly B Klarman; Youseline Cajusma; Lerby Exantus; Jude Ronald Beausejour; Katelyn E Flaherty; Valery Madsen Beau de Rochars; Chantale Baril; Eric J Nelson,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025-Jun-30,,,"BACKGROUND: One of the most difficult challenges in pediatric telemedicine is to accurately discriminate between the 'sick' and 'not sick' child, especially in resource-limited settings. Models that flag potentially 'sick' cases for additional safety checks represent an opportunity for telemedicine to reach its potential. However, there are critical knowledge gaps on how to develop such models and integrate them into electronic clinical decision support (eCDS) tools. METHODS: To address this challenge, we developed a study design that utilized data from paired virtual and in-person exams at a telemedicine and medication delivery service (TMDS) in Haiti. Providers were allowed to mark respondent data as potentially unreliable. Artificial intelligence /machine learning (XGBoost) was applied to analyze paired data from participants across three consecutive implementation studies. Model derivation focused on identifying 'sick' patients (not-mild) and those requiring escalation. An ensemble method, based on gradient boosted decision-trees, was used given the limited sample size. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: A total of 683 paired records were available for this secondary analysis from 2225 participants enrolled. The median age was 15 months and 47% were female. For prediction of a 'sick' child, we found an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.86) after 5-fold cross validation; calibration slope and intercept were 1.31 (95%CI:1.09-1.53) and 0.04 (95%CI:-0.14-0.23), respectively. For prediction of escalation, we found an AUC of 0.78 (95%CI:0.74-0.81); calibration slope and intercept were 0.63 (95%CI:0.52-0.74) and 0.05 (95%CI:0.52-0.74), respectively. Accounting for data marked as potentially unreliable had mixed effects. INTERPRETATION: These methods and findings offer an innovative and important proof-of-concept to improve pediatric telemedicine. The models require external validation prior to eCDS integration and deployment. Once validated, the models are designed to provide a critical safety check for experienced providers and digitally convey expertise to new providers.
